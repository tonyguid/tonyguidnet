OK, rebooting the blog process.

I used an [MSDN Blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/tonyguid) previously, but thought I might start re-branding myself here. I'll be primarily focused on cloud scenarios - short-term, thinking about big data, analytics, patterns for massive data movement, etc... but stay tuned, I tend to venture into other intersting things.

BTW - much thanks to [Jason Young](http://ytechie.com) for providing me with a blogging platform that is pretty darn easy to use!
